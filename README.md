# Beyond generating code: Evaluating GPT on a Data Visualization Course

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper "_Beyond Generating Code: Evaluating GPT on a Data
Visualization Course_".

![Teaser Figure: Our experiments show that GPT can a) clean and explore CSV datasets, b) read visualizations in SVG format, interact with visualizations through dispatching Javascript events, and c) create explanatory visualizations to present data insights.](src/teasear.png)

## Structure

### Quiz

[This folder](./Quiz) contains materials for the weekly quizzes, including:
- `code`: The code for data processing, chat completion and grade evaluation.
- `data_by_week`: The processed data of weekly quiz.
- `Grade_Report`: The grade summary for each GPT model and quiz type.
- `examples_by_type`: The QA examples of each quiz type.

For more details, please refer to [Quiz/README.md](./Quiz/README.md).

### Homework

[This folder](./Homework) contains materials for the homework, including:
- `GPT3` and `GPT4`: Prompt, code, and data GPT used and generated when working on the homework assignments week by week.
- `To Grade`: The homework assignments that are ready to be graded.
