## 1) Design Critique 
### Task 1.1: Critique

The 'How India Eats' visualization is aimed at a general audience interested in learning about food consumption patterns across different states in India. The objective of the design is to display the proportion of vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets across various states in India, shedding light on regional variations in food habits. The visualization tries to answer questions like: "What is the percentage of vegetarians across different states in India?", "Which states are predominantly vegetarian or non-vegetarian?", "How do food habits vary regionally within India?".

The design elements related to the objective include the use of India's map and the color-coded representation of diets in each state. The color scheme shows the vegetarian percentage from a scale of 0% to 100%, using shades from red for 0% to green for 100%. This allows the reader to get a quick overview of the prevailing food habits in each state.

The visualization has its strengths and weaknesses:

Positive aspects:
1. The use of a map provides a strong geographical context, allowing the reader to immediately recognize India and grasp the regional distribution of diets.
2. The color-coded representation is an effective way to visualize the data on a continuous scale from 0% to 100%. The choice of green for vegetarian and red for non-vegetarian is conventional and immediately understandable for the audience.
3. The title "How India Eats" is clear and informative, drawing the audience's attention to the subject matter and encouraging further exploration.

Negative aspects:
1. Labels are missing from the states, limiting the audience's ability to identify individual states and hindering understanding for those unfamiliar with India's geography. A key or a hover-over feature providing state names and exact percentages could enhance the visualization.
2. The continuous color scale makes it difficult to discern precise vegetarian percentages. A clearer legend might help, but the visualization might benefit from using discrete color categories for better differentiation.
3. The visualization lacks a clear source for the data, making it difficult for users to assess the credibility of the information presented.

Overall, the 'How India Eats' visualization achieves its primary objective by providing a quick overview of food habits across India. However, it could be improved in terms of labelling and state identification, as well as the clarity of the percentage scale. I like the visualization for its simplicity and at-a-glance understanding of regional variations in food habits, but believe that the negative aspects mentioned above limit its effectiveness and reliability.
