## 1) Design Critique 
### Task 1.1: Critique

The 'How India Eats' visualization is aimed at a general audience interested in learning about food consumption patterns across different states in India. The objective of the design is to display the proportion of vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets across various states in India, shedding light on regional variations in food habits. The visualization tries to answer questions like: "What is the percentage of vegetarians across different states in India?", "Which states are predominantly vegetarian or non-vegetarian?", "How do food habits vary regionally within India?".

The design elements related to the objective include the use of India's map and the color-coded representation of diets in each state. The color scheme shows the vegetarian percentage from a scale of 0% to 100%, using shades from red for 0% to green for 100%. This allows the reader to get a quick overview of the prevailing food habits in each state.

The visualization has its strengths and weaknesses:

Positive aspects:
1. The use of a map provides a strong geographical context, allowing the reader to immediately recognize India and grasp the regional distribution of diets.
2. The color-coded representation is an effective way to visualize the data on a continuous scale from 0% to 100%. The choice of green for vegetarian and red for non-vegetarian is conventional and immediately understandable for the audience.
3. The title "How India Eats" is clear and informative, drawing the audience's attention to the subject matter and encouraging further exploration.

Negative aspects:
1. Labels are missing from the states, limiting the audience's ability to identify individual states and hindering understanding for those unfamiliar with India's geography. A key or a hover-over feature providing state names and exact percentages could enhance the visualization.
2. The continuous color scale makes it difficult to discern precise vegetarian percentages. A clearer legend might help, but the visualization might benefit from using discrete color categories for better differentiation.
3. The visualization lacks a clear source for the data, making it difficult for users to assess the credibility of the information presented.

Overall, the 'How India Eats' visualization achieves its primary objective by providing a quick overview of food habits across India. However, it could be improved in terms of labelling and state identification, as well as the clarity of the percentage scale. I like the visualization for its simplicity and at-a-glance understanding of regional variations in food habits, but believe that the negative aspects mentioned above limit its effectiveness and reliability.

### Task 1.2: Re-design
In this alternative visualization, I used a pie chart to represent the data of how people in India eat. This improved the data-ink ratio by removing unnecessary designs, patterns, and colors found in the original infographic. By focusing solely on the percentage distribution while maintaining a consistent color scheme, this plot prioritizes the important information and increases readability.

I also improved the graphical integrity by utilizing accurate percentage representations rather than imprecise visuals such as forks, knives, and plates. Adding a legend and caption ensures that readers can quickly and accurately understand which segments represent each category while keeping the focus on the data. Moreover, this design can be resized and adapts to varying screen sizes, making it more adaptable and accessible.

## 2) Graphical Integrity, Gestalt Principles, C.R.A.P. Principles 

### Task 2.1: Graphical integrity

The visualization titled "The shrinking family doctor" appears to be a bar chart that represents the number of family doctors attending Harvard Medical School over the years from 1996 to 2006. Here is the evaluation of the chart based on Tufte's ideas:

a) Graphical Integrity: The chart seems to have a decent graphical integrity and accurately represents the data. The labels, axis scale, data representation, and context all seem to be consistent across the chart. One possible concern is the chosen y-axis scale (minimum of 10). Ideally, the y-axis should start at 0 to avoid exaggerating the differences between the bars.

b) Lie Factor: The chart appears to have a low lie factor. The percentage decline in the number of family doctors is presented accurately, without trying to mislead the viewers. However, starting the y-axis at 10 could lead to an inflated perception of the decline.

c) Data-Ink Ratio: The data-ink ratio could be improved substantially. There are some unnecessary elements in the chart that may not contribute to the information displayed. The gridlines behind the bars and the horizontal ticks on the x-axis are not necessary and add an extra element that might distract the viewer. The year labels alternating between the top and bottom of the x-axis could be made consistent and placed below the bars to maintain a simple layout. By removing excess elements, the chart can better emphasize the essential data.

d) Chart Junk: One notable chart junk is the way the year labels are displayed at the bottom of the chart. They alternate between being above and below horizontal ticks, which might cause confusion and distract from the main data. Also, the 3D effect on the bars can be considered chart junk, as it does not add any value or clarity to the chart.

To improve the data-ink ratio, the chart can be modified as follows:

1. Remove the gridlines and horizontal ticks on the x-axis.
2. Remove the 3D effect from the bars.
3. Make the year labels consistent and place them below the bars.
4. Consider starting the y-axis at 0 for an accurate representation of the data.
