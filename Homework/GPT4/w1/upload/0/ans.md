b. Critiques:

Good visualization (Global Climate Risk Index 2020):
This visualization effectively depicts the impact of climate change, with countries that are most affected shown in darker shades. It is good because it presents a clear message with easy-to-understand visual cues. The color scale is used appropriately to represent the data, and a legend is provided to help the viewer interpret the map correctly. The authors were most likely trying to raise awareness about which countries are most at risk for climate change, and they succeeded in doing so. An improvement to this visualization could be the addition of ranks for each country, which would make it easier for the viewer to understand the exact rankings.

Bad visualization (Star Trek Bechdel Test Results by Season):
This visualization is difficult to understand due to the lack of clear labels and unnecessary encoding of data. There are multiple colors and shapes used, which make it hard to discern what each represents. The authors were likely trying to show how Star Trek fared in the Bechdel Test in different seasons, but their representation of the data is confusing. To improve this visualization, they could use bar charts to show the scores for each season more clearly, with a single color for passed tests and another color for failed tests. This would simplify the chart and make it easier to understand.
