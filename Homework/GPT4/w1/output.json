Good & Bad Visualizations (4 points)\nThe use of visualization to present information is pervasive in the media. A visual representation is a powerful and effective way to make complicated and confusing information more relevant and easy to understand.\n\nHere are some general questions to consider as you go through the next section: What is your opinion about good and bad visualizations? What are good visualization characteristics? What makes a visualization bad, hard to understand, or misleading (communicating the wrong information)?\n\na. Find one good and one bad visualization\nChoose two examples from different authors and online sources. You can use http://viz.wtf/ for inspiration, but please try to find examples from other sources.\n\nInclude a screenshot of the visualization along with a reference (URL) to the source.\nWhere did you find it? Title? Add any relevant information about it.\nOn a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best), how good or bad is this visualization?\n\nb. Give a brief (one paragraph) critique for each visualization - why is it good or bad? Include the following:\nDescribe the positive and negative aspects. Be as specific as possible.\nAuthors of visualizations try to answer specific questions about a dataset. What questions do you think the authors tried to answer? Did they succeed?\nWhat improvements to the visualization would you suggest?\n"}], "output": "a. Good visualization:\n![Global Climate Risk Index 2020](https://www.germanwatch.org/sites/germanwatch.org/files/20-2-01e%20CRI%20Map_EN_RESI-FH200.jpg)\n\nSource: Germanwatch\nURL: https://www.germanwatch.org/en/4711\nTitle: Global Climate Risk Index 2020\nScale: 5\n\nBad visualization:\n![Graph: Star Trek Bechdel Test Results by Season](https://storage.googleapis.com/zam-assets/editorial/2015/05/trektest.png)\n\nSource: Zam\nURL: https://www.zam.com/article/684/star-trek-and-the-bechdel-test\nTitle: Star Trek Bechdel Test Results by Season\nScale: 2\n\nb. Critiques:\n\nGood visualization (Global Climate Risk Index 2020):\nThis visualization effectively depicts the impact of climate change, with countries that are most affected shown in darker shades. It is good because it presents a clear message with easy-to-understand visual cues. The color scale is used appropriately to represent the data, and a legend is provided to help the viewer interpret the map correctly. The authors were most likely trying to raise awareness about which countries are most at risk for climate change, and they succeeded in doing so. An improvement to this visualization could be the addition of ranks for each country, which would make it easier for the viewer to understand the exact rankings.\n\nBad visualization (Star Trek Bechdel Test Results by Season):\nThis visualization is difficult to understand due to the lack of clear labels and unnecessary encoding of data. There are multiple colors and shapes used, which make it hard to discern what each represents. The authors were likely trying to show how Star Trek fared in the Bechdel Test in different seasons, but their representation of the data is confusing. To improve this visualization, they could use bar charts to show the scores for each season more clearly, with a single color for passed tests and another color for failed tests. This would simplify the chart and make it easier to understand."}, {"p_idx": 1, "input": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student who has took cs171 Data Visualization at Harvard."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nIn this homework, you will consider different visualizations and analyze their primary purpose, whether they succeed or not, and the critical aspects of what makes visualizations compelling, effective, and impactful.\n\nIf you have not done so already, please also complete HW0 on Canvas (Canvas/Modules/Course Preview) as well.\n\n## 2. Exploratory vs. Explanatory Visualizations (4 points)\nLook at these online examples of exploratory and explanatory visualizations.\n- You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children\u2019s College Chances (if you hit hit the NYT paywall, Google \u201cYou Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children\u2019s College Chances\u201d and click on the first result)\n- An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton\n- Bussed out - How America moves its homeless\n\nFor each of these visualizations, tell us:\n- Is it exploratory or explanatory, and why do you think so?\n- What question(s) about the data did the authors try to answer?\n- What new insights did you learn from the visualization?\n- Who is the likely audience of the visualization?\n- Does it have a point of view or a message, and can you describe it?\n"}], "output": "**You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children\u2019s College Chances**\n- This visualization is explanatory because it provides a narrative about how family income affects the chances of children going to college, inviting the user to guess the relationship by drawing lines first.\n- The authors tried to answer the question: \"How does family income predict the likelihood of children attending a college or university?\"\n- From the visualization, I learned that higher family income correlates significantly with increased college attendance rates. There is a significant gap in college chances between high-income and low-income families.\n- The likely audience is people interested in understanding the impact of financial background on educational opportunities, such as policymakers, parents, students, and educators.\n- The point of view is that family income greatly influences the chances of children attending college, emphasizing the importance of addressing the inequality of educational opportunities based on financial backgrounds.\n\n**An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton**\n- This visualization is exploratory as it allows users to freely navigate and interact with the data to find interesting patterns in the Hamilton musical song lyrics.\n- The authors tried to answer questions like: \"How are characters connected in Hamilton?\", \"How do they interact, and what themes are most common or significant throughout the musical?\"\n- From the visualization, I gained insights into the intricate relationships between Hamilton characters, themes, and their lyrical interactions.\n- The likely audience is fans of Hamilton or individuals interested in analyzing the musical, character relationships, and the evolution of themes.\n- The message is more neutral and focused on providing an interesting and engaging way to discover connections and themes within the musical.\n\n**Bussed Out - How America Moves Its Homeless**\n- This visualization is explanatory because it reveals the trend of American cities moving homeless populations by providing interactive visualizations and explanations.\n- The authors tried to answer the question: \"Where do homeless people in US cities go, and how are they relocated while addressing homelessness?\"\n- The visualization shows that many cities actively move their homeless populations to other places and that the problem is nationwide, rather than just a local concern.\n- The likely audience includes people interested in understanding the homelessness crisis in the United States, such as policymakers, housing advocates, and concerned citizens.\n- The point of view is critical of the practice of bussing out homeless individuals and focusing on the need to address this systemic problem that affects numerous cities across the country."}]
