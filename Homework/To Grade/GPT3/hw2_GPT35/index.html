          <h2>Analysis of Top 10 Salaries at Google Infographic</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Who is the audience?</strong><br />
            The audience appears to be job seekers interested in working at Google,
            as the infographic answers the question "What does it take to get a job at Google?"
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What questions does it answer?</strong><br />
            The infographic answers questions about the top 10 highest paying jobs at Google,
            the qualification requirements for these jobs, and the typical salaries for each job.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What is the data? be specific, including data types (N,O,Q).</strong><br />
            The data includes 10 job positions at Google, their minimum experience or education
            requirements (O), and their median and senior salaries (Q).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              For each data type, how is it visually encoded?
            </strong><br />
            The minimum requirements are encoded using bar charts showing the number of years of
            work experience or the level of education required. The median and senior salaries for
            each job are encoded using dollar amounts with color coding to differentiate between
            the two types of salaries and to highlight the highest paying jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Do you consider this to be a 'good' visualization? Why or why not?</strong><br />
            I consider this to be a good visualization because it effectively answers the
            questions posed by its audience. The use of bar charts with color coding allows for
            easy comparison between different job positions, and the high contrast colors make
            it easy to identify the highest paying jobs. The use of dollar amounts to show salaries
            makes it easy for the audience to understand the relative pay differences between different jobs.
