              <p> The infographic has both positives and negatives. The inforgraphic
                tries to convey the positions with the top salaries at Google,
                and what the salaries are for those positions, as shown by the title.
                Therefore, the intended audience for the infographic seems to be
                employees/prospective employees for Google, as well as hiring manangers
                both within and outside of Google. This means that the audience
                generally has knowledge about what the roles means, and therefore,
                the design with the job position name and salary works well. The use of
                quantitative data also helps the user gain specific information
                from the infographic. Additionally,
                the addition of the rank next to each position clarifies the infographic
                and makes it easier to get important information from it quickly.
                However, the interior design with the overlapping pie chart reflects poor
                infographic design. The ten different colors overlapping each
                other with different lines point at them makes it very difficult
                to keep track of what is being showing in the chart. Overall, this one part
                of the infographic is too clutter and confusing, affecting an otherwise
                concise, and easy-to-understand inforgraphic
              </p>
