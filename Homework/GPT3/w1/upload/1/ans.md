b. Critique:

Good Visualization:
This visualization from the New York Times is exceptional as it communicates information about the impact of COVID-19 deaths in the USA with two clear and effective visualizations. The choropleth maps show the distribution of deaths across states, complemented by a scatter plot illustrating the population-adjusted rate of deaths per state. The color scheme effectively conveys the severity difference across different states. The post's intention is to convey a clear message contrasted with previous assumptions, and the visualization succeeds in each and every way possible.

Bad Visualization:
This visualization has several issues, starting from the use of overwhelming pie charts to represent data. The chart does not provide any visual cues as to what category is being explained other than pie size, which can be extremely maddening, especially for people with color-blindness. The chart doesn't have a proper title; as a result, it becomes problematic to know what the author tried to convey. It doesn't communicate a clear message, and indeed, the visualization is overall confusing. I must suggest some improvements - firstly to use legible fonts, provide categorical data in a tabular form, and should use a better visualization technique, such as a stacked bar graph or a histogram, to convey the distribution of data points.

## 2. Exploratory vs. Explanatory Visualizations

1. You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Childrenâ€™s College Chances
- This visualization is explanatory as it is trying to explain a relationship between two variables (family income and college admissions) to the audience.
- The authors try to answer the question of how family income affects a child's chance of getting into college.
- The new insight I learned from this visualization is that there is a significant gap between college admission rates for high- and low- income families, which suggests that wealthier families have an advantage in the college admissions process.
- The likely audience for this visualization is the general public, including parents who are concerned about their children's college prospects and policymakers who may be interested in issues of education and income equality.
- The visualization has a point of view or message: that the college admissions process is not purely merit-based and that family income and other factors may also contribute to a student's chances of admission.

2. An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton
- This visualization is exploratory as it allows the audience to explore the lyrics of the song and learn more about the content of the musical.
- The authors do not necessarily try to answer a specific question, but rather provide a way for the audience to engage with the lyrics and themes of the musical.
- The new insight I learned from this visualization is a deeper understanding of the content and themes of the musical. The visualization allows the audience to see which characters are singing which parts of the song and how the lyrics relate to one another.
- The likely audience for this visualization is fans of the musical or people interested in musical theater.
- The visualization does not necessarily have a specific point of view or message but rather serves as a tool for exploring the content of the musical.

3. Bussed out - How America moves its homeless
- This visualization is explanatory as it is trying to explain the complex issue of how different cities in America transport homeless individuals to other cities.
- The authors try to answer the question of how and why cities transport their homeless populations to other cities and which cities are most affected by this practice.
- The new insight I learned from this visualization is the extent to which this practice occurs across the United States and the disproportionate impact it has on certain cities and regions.
- The likely audience for this visualization is policymakers and advocates for the homeless who may be interested in addressing issues of homelessness and/or mobility.
- The visualization has a point of view or message: it suggests that the transportation of homeless individuals is a concerning and potentially harmful practice that needs to be addressed through policy changes.
