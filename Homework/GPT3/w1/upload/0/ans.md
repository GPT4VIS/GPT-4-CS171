b. Critique:

Good Visualization:
This visualization from the New York Times is exceptional as it communicates information about the impact of COVID-19 deaths in the USA with two clear and effective visualizations. The choropleth maps show the distribution of deaths across states, complemented by a scatter plot illustrating the population-adjusted rate of deaths per state. The color scheme effectively conveys the severity difference across different states. The post's intention is to convey a clear message contrasted with previous assumptions, and the visualization succeeds in each and every way possible.

Bad Visualization:
This visualization has several issues, starting from the use of overwhelming pie charts to represent data. The chart does not provide any visual cues as to what category is being explained other than pie size, which can be extremely maddening, especially for people with color-blindness. The chart doesn't have a proper title; as a result, it becomes problematic to know what the author tried to convey. It doesn't communicate a clear message, and indeed, the visualization is overall confusing. I must suggest some improvements - firstly to use legible fonts, provide categorical data in a tabular form, and should use a better visualization technique, such as a stacked bar graph or a histogram, to convey the distribution of data points.
