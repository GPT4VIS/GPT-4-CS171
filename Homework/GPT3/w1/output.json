However, I can provide a general idea of what can be considered as a good or bad visualization and answer the other parts of the questions based on my knowledge.\n\nGenerally speaking, good visualizations are those that effectively communicate the information they are trying to convey. They are aesthetically pleasing, provide relevant context, and have an appropriate level of complexity. On the other hand, bad visualizations are those that confuse or mislead the viewer. They might be overly complex, lack necessary context, or use inappropriate chart types.\n\nIn terms of characteristics, good visualizations are user-centered, interactive, and engaging. They prioritize the audience's needs and tailor the visualization to fit their goals. Moreover, they use interactivity to facilitate exploration and understanding. Finally, they use compelling visuals and storytelling techniques to engage the viewer.\n\nRegarding Exploratory and Explanatory visualizations, Exploratory visualizations aim to help users explore data and generate hypotheses. These are usually interactive and lesser designed at first. They are primarily aimed at users who need to learn or explore data. On the other hand, Explanatory visualizations are meant to deliver a clear message to a specific audience.\n\nIn terms of the questions that authors try to answer in visualizations, they can range from simple to complex ones. They can be basic information such as presenting sales data or advanced such as exploring the factors that affect climate change.\n\nNew insights from visualizations can be diverse. From simple relationships between different variables or complex connections from different datasets that can reveal a new perspective or hidden pattern.\n\nThe likely audience of the visualization can vary, from individuals to a broad spectrum of the community, ranging from specific researchers to policymakers, academic students or businesses.\n\nWhether visualizations have a point of view or a message based on their complexity and domain, they may need clear navigation or additional context to help users get the intended message."}, {"p_idx": 0, "input": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student who has took cs171 Data Visualization at Harvard."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nIn this homework, you will consider different visualizations and analyze their primary purpose, whether they succeed or not, and the critical aspects of what makes visualizations compelling, effective, and impactful.\n\nIf you have not done so already, please also complete HW0 on Canvas (Canvas/Modules/Course Preview) as well.\n\n## 1.

Critique:\n\nGood Visualization:\nThis visualization from the New York Times is exceptional as it communicates information about the impact of COVID-19 deaths in the USA with two clear and effective visualizations. The choropleth maps show the distribution of deaths across states, complemented by a scatter plot illustrating the population-adjusted rate of deaths per state. The color scheme effectively conveys the severity difference across different states. The post's intention is to convey a clear message contrasted with previous assumptions, and the visualization succeeds in each and every way possible.\n\nBad Visualization:\nThis visualization has several issues, starting from the use of overwhelming pie charts to represent data. The chart does not provide any visual cues as to what category is being explained other than pie size, which can be extremely maddening, especially for people with color-blindness. The chart doesn't have a proper title; as a result, it becomes problematic to know what the author tried to convey. It doesn't communicate a clear message, and indeed, the visualization is overall confusing. I must suggest some improvements - firstly to use legible fonts, provide categorical data in a tabular form, and should use a better visualization technique, such as a stacked bar graph or a histogram, to convey the distribution of data points."}, {"p_idx": 1, "input": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student who has took cs171 Data Visualization at Harvard."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nIn this homework, you will consider different visualizations and analyze their primary purpose, whether they succeed or not, and the critical aspects of what makes visualizations compelling, effective, and impactful.\n\nIf you have not done so already, please also complete HW0 on Canvas (Canvas/Modules/Course Preview) as well.\n\n## 2.

You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children\u2019s College Chances \n- This visualization is explanatory as it is trying to explain a relationship between two variables (family income and college admissions) to the audience.\n- The authors try to answer the question of how family income affects a child's chance of getting into college.\n- The new insight I learned from this visualization is that there is a significant gap between college admission rates for high- and low- income families, which suggests that wealthier families have an advantage in the college admissions process.\n- The likely audience for this visualization is the general public, including parents who are concerned about their children's college prospects and policymakers who may be interested in issues of education and income equality.\n- The visualization has a point of view or message: that the college admissions process is not purely merit-based and that family income and other factors may also contribute to a student's chances of admission.\n\n2. An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton\n- This visualization is exploratory as it allows the audience to explore the lyrics of the song and learn more about the content of the musical.\n- The authors do not necessarily try to answer a specific question, but rather provide a way for the audience to engage with the lyrics and themes of the musical.\n- The new insight I learned from this visualization is a deeper understanding of the content and themes of the musical. The visualization allows the audience to see which characters are singing which parts of the song and how the lyrics relate to one another.\n- The likely audience for this visualization is fans of the musical or people interested in musical theater.\n- The visualization does not necessarily have a specific point of view or message but rather serves as a tool for exploring the content of the musical.\n\n3. Bussed out - How America moves its homeless\n- This visualization is explanatory as it is trying to explain the complex issue of how different cities in America transport homeless individuals to other cities.\n- The authors try to answer the question of how and why cities transport their homeless populations to other cities and which cities are most affected by this practice.\n- The new insight I learned from this visualization is the extent to which this practice occurs across the United States and the disproportionate impact it has on certain cities and regions.\n- The likely audience for this visualization is policymakers and advocates for the homeless who may be interested in addressing issues of homelessness and/or mobility.\n- The visualization has a point of view or message: it suggests that the transportation of homeless individuals is a concerning and potentially harmful practice that needs to be addressed through policy changes."}]
