In this homework, you will consider different visualizations and analyze their primary purpose, whether they succeed or not, and the critical aspects of what makes visualizations compelling, effective, and impactful.

If you have not done so already, please also complete HW0 on Canvas (Canvas/Modules/Course Preview) as well.

## 1. Good & Bad Visualizations (4 points)
The use of visualization to present information is pervasive in the media. A visual representation is a powerful and effective way to make complicated and confusing information more relevant and easy to understand.

Here are some general questions to consider as you go through the next section: What is your opinion about good and bad visualizations? What are good visualization characteristics? What makes a visualization bad, hard to understand, or misleading (communicating the wrong information)?

a. Find one good and one bad visualization
Choose two examples from different authors and online sources. You can use http://viz.wtf/ for inspiration, but please try to find examples from other sources.

Include a screenshot of the visualization along with a reference (URL) to the source.
Where did you find it? Title? Add any relevant information about it.
On a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best), how good or bad is this visualization?

b. Give a brief (one paragraph) critique for each visualization - why is it good or bad? Include the following:
Describe the positive and negative aspects. Be as specific as possible.
Authors of visualizations try to answer specific questions about a dataset. What questions do you think the authors tried to answer? Did they succeed?
What improvements to the visualization would you suggest?

## 2. Exploratory vs. Explanatory Visualizations (4 points)
Look at these online examples of exploratory and explanatory visualizations.
- You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children’s College Chances (if you hit hit the NYT paywall, Google “You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children’s College Chances” and click on the first result)
- An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton
- Bussed out - How America moves its homeless

For each of these visualizations, tell us:
- Is it exploratory or explanatory, and why do you think so?
- What question(s) about the data did the authors try to answer?
- What new insights did you learn from the visualization?
- Who is the likely audience of the visualization?
- Does it have a point of view or a message, and can you describe it?
