### Task 1.2: Re-design
Caption: "Visualizing the eating habits of Indian cities based on the type of cuisine with improved data-ink ratio and graphical integrity."

Legend: "North Indian - Green, South Indian - Blue, Chinese - Orange, Italian - Red, Continental - Purple"

To improve the data-ink ratio, I have removed unnecessary gridlines, duplicated information, and reduced the use of colors to represent data. Instead of using a stacked bar chart, I have used a stacked horizontal bar chart that shows the percentage of cuisine types for each city. I have also used a white background to improve the readability of the chart.

For better graphical integrity, I have used a consistent color palette for each cuisine type, added axis labels and values, and reduced the cluttering of text in the chart.

Overall, the alternative visualization provides a better representation of the data with improved clarity, making it easier for the audience to understand and interpret the eating habits of Indian cities.
