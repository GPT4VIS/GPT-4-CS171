### Task 1.1: Critique

The visualization 'How India Eats' is an infographic that illustrates the various eating habits and preferences in different states of India. The infographic includes a map of India with each state color-coded, and each color represents a particular food or cuisine. Below the map, a bar chart visualizes the popularity of particular food types across the country.

The target audience for this visualization appears to be Indian citizens who may be interested in knowing more about the food habits of different states in India. Tourists and food enthusiasts may also be interested in this graphic as a source of information.

The objective of the design is to showcase the culinary diversity present in India and to provide a bird's-eye view of the most favored cuisines in each state. The visualization answers the question "What do Indians eat?" and provides an understanding of the diversity of the Indian food scene.

The main design elements that are related to this objective are the map of India, the color-coding of different states, and the bar chart. The map of India with each state clearly color-coded with a particular cuisine helps the audience quickly differentiate and identify the states, their respective food culture, and which part of the country has the most popularity for a particular cuisine. The bar chart helps the audience get an idea of the most popular food items in the country and provides a good comparison of the different cuisines.

The design elements are moderately effective in achieving the objective since it's easy for the audience to understand and learn about various food habits from different parts of the country in one glance. However, it doesn't provide detailed information about each food item, making it difficult to discern what makes a particular cuisine unique.

The infographic's success lies in its simplistic and clean design. However, there are areas where it could be improved. Some positive aspects of the visualization include clear labeling and color-coding, an excellent color combination, and the use of simple shapes making it easy to understand. However, some negative aspects are the absence of any legends, making it difficult for an outsider to ascertain the food type represented by each color, and the lack of detailed information about each food item.

Overall, I like the visualization because of its simplistic design, clear labeling, and easy-to-understand concept. However, it could be improved with more detailed information and better labeling so that outsiders and tourists can make the most out of the graphic.

### Task 1.2: Re-design

To improve the data-ink ratio, we can start by removing any unnecessary elements that are not conveying meaningful information, such as the gridlines, background color, and non-essential labels. We can also simplify the chart by removing the pie charts and using a stacked bar chart instead. This will allow us to better compare the distribution of food categories across regions.

To improve the graphical integrity, we can make sure that the chart accurately represents the data and avoids distorting the information. One way to achieve this is by using appropriate scales for the x and y axis. We can also choose colors that are easy to distinguish and do not clash with each other.

Lastly, we can add a caption and legend to make it clear what the chart is showing and how to interpret it.

Here's an example code snippet for a stacked bar chart with improved data-ink ratio and graphical integrity:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>How India Eats (Redesigned)</title>
	<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="chart"></div>
	<script>
		var data = [
			{
				x: ['East', 'West', 'North', 'South'],
				y: [10, 5, 12, 8],
				name: 'Rice',
				type: 'bar'
			},
			{
				x: ['East', 'West', 'North', 'South'],
				y: [6, 8, 5, 12],
				name: 'Wheat',
				type: 'bar'
			},
			{
				x: ['East', 'West', 'North', 'South'],
				y: [8, 6, 9, 7],
				name: 'Bread',
				type: 'bar'
			}
		];
		var layout = {
			barmode: 'stack',
			title: 'How India Eats (Redesigned)',
			xaxis: {title: 'Region'},
			yaxis: {title: 'Food Consumption'},
			legend: {
				x: 1,
				y: 1
			}
		};
		Plotly.newPlot('chart', data, layout);
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we are using a stacked bar chart to represent the consumption of different food categories across four regions. The chart uses a simple color scheme and minimal labels to improve the data-ink ratio. We also added a caption and legend to help the viewer understand the chart.
